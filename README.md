# 🎓 Greedy Algorithms & Dynamic Programming

This repo contains two algorithmic challenges:

1. 🚀 3D Print Queue Optimization
A greedy scheduler that batches 3D-print jobs by priority and printer limits.

2. ✂️ Rod Cutting Problem
Two DP approaches (top-down memoization & bottom-up tabulation) for max profit cuts.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- colorama (for colored test output)

```bash
pip install colorama
```

## 📌 Usage Examples

```bash
# 3D Print Queue Optimization
python optimize_printing.py
# → Test 1 (same priority): order ['M1', 'M2', 'M3'], total time 270 min

# Rod Cutting
python rod_cutting.py
# → Basic Case: max profit 12, cuts [1, 2, 2], #cuts 2
```
